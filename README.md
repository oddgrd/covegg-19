# Covegg-19
MERN-stack app to manage and create problems for my home climbing wall. The app consists of a Node/Express backend with Google oauth authentication, and a React/Redux frontend. User data, problems and ascents are stored in a MongoDB cluster. Board images are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The app is deployed on Heroku.
The app works just fine on big screens, but was designed for mobile.
